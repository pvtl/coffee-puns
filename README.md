# Coffee Shop Coffee Puns

At Pivotal, we love a good [pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun). It's our challenge to throw as many coffee-related puns at our local coffee shop owner. Here's our collection.

### Piccolo
"Please can I have you finest caramel slice."  
"Will this one here do?"  
"Oh no no no. Please __piccolo__-er one; that one just there."

### Coffee Beans
"How's your day mate?"  
"Yeah really good. I'm a keen __bean__ for coffee this morning, I tell you what!"

### Grind
(Waiter hands coffee to customer)  
Customer: "Thanks...I guess it's back to the daily-__grind__ for me. Cheers Pablo."

### Hot and Strong Coffee

### Tamper
(Customer looking through cake cabinet)  
"You got any caramel slice left?"  
"Nah mate, sorry brother..."  
"You're really making me lose my __tamper__ here..."

### Coffee Shot
(Waiter tallying up customers order)  
"Alright, that's $13.50 thanks."
